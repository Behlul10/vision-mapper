**Week #:** 2

**Name:** Behlul Vardal

## 1. Retrospective (reflecting on last week)
- What went well? I basically hit a wall last week where I tried to get typescript to work, this week I learned how to use web build tool called Vite, and successfully got to run and compile typescript.
- What didn’t go well?   Since I Was learning how to use a web build tool called vite, I didnt get to actually write any code in typescript, I just got a demo from online.
- What can I improve next week? I can start up a new test demo and build it from the ground up by myself but this time write the demo myself or at least understand how the demo works.


## 2. Current State (Context)
Summarize where the project stands right now (2–3 bullet points).
  - There has been progress made mainly with my skill gap.
  - I will need a pipeline test next


## 3. User Story (Next Sprint Focus)
Write one or two clear User Stories that define the goal of your next sprint.
I'm mainly going to be working on backend stuff, so the code I do for my next sprint wont be something for the user experience.
Infact it wont really be built for the user, itll be for the developer.

So as the developer I Want to see the landmark data in the terminal, so that I can understand the MediaPipe library a little better. And know how the MediaPipe Pipeline works by doing it in real time.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
Define 1–3 testable conditions that prove your User Story is satisfied.
Given the web cam is turned on and the project is runnning on the browser, when the project runs then the terminal will print landmark data.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)
Describe what it means for this sprint’s User Story to be considered complete.

*The work is considered done when the terminal prints landmark data.

## 6. Blockers (as Help Requests)
Identify problems slowing or stopping your progress, framed as help requests.
- Blocker: Understanding of pipelines and mediapipe. Also just trying to understand the other demos is hard enough. I didn't notice before but in modwen web projects there are a lot of nested html elements
    - this makes it harder to read a simple action and makes the code longer.
- Help Request: I dont know, I can't really change web standards.

## 7. Goals (Steps Toward the DoD)
List the specific outcomes you aim to complete this week that will move you toward fulfilling your Definition of Done. These can be partial achievements or incremental tasks.
  - Pipeline Terminal Demo
## 8. Next Steps
List the concrete, actionable tasks you will complete before the next class/report.
  - Start a new directory for a terminal demo
  - Start building the the project with web build tool vite
  - Take the previous demo and print the landmarks to terminal in script
